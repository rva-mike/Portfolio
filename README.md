# Portfolio

## About

This is a Portfolio that was created with the purpose of showcasing my work as an upcoming developer and exemplifying my skills. Currently, it includes 3 sections; An 'About' section, a "Projects" section, and a "Contact" section. When clicked, the projects will link to their deployed web application pages. I will be updating this website and the content of this repository as I continue my journey. At the moment, I have used HTML and CSS in its creation.
