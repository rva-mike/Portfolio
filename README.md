# Portfolio

## About

This is a responsive web Portfolio that was created with the purpose of showcasing my work as an upcoming developer and exemplifying my skills. Currently, it includes 3 sections; An 'About' section, a 'Projects' section, and a 'Contact' section. When clicked, the projects will link to their deployed web application pages. I will be updating this website and the content of this repository as I continue my journey. At the moment, I have used HTML and CSS in its creation.
